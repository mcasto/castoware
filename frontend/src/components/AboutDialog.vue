          His experience with HTML extends to the mid-90s. He started
          incorporating Javascript and CSS into projects in the late 90s and
          started working with PHP in 2000. He has been working exclusively as a
          freelance web developer since 2000.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, he updated his Javascript knowledge and started working with
          VueJS and Vuetify.
        </p>
        <p>
          His default stack now uses PHP on the backend and VueJS with the
          Quasar framework on the front.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has worked a bit with Firebase Realtime Database, but most of his
          database experience is with MySQL and SQLite.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has also used VueJS, NodeJS, and the Quasar framework to develop
          desktop applications with Electron.

          He developed his first website for a client in 1996.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1997, he founded CastoWare Development and worked as a freelancer
          to develop Visual Basic app that ran as a CGI on a Windows server to
          generate HTML forms used by employees of the LM Berry Company to input
          information for the online Yellow Pages. It also handled the searches
          and output the online Yellow Pages themselves. In 1998, that app won
          an in-company award.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1998 and 1999, he worked in the IT department at the Berry Company
          and developed a Visual Basic application used in their call centers to
          interact with the Genesys telephony suite.
        </p>
        <p>
          In late 1999, he returned to freelance work and spent a couple of
          years working with ColdFusion.
